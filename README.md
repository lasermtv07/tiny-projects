# tiny projects
tiny project i made in the span of a few days and that I deemed not deserving its own repo

- **PySimpleGui tic tac toe** - a simple 3x3 graphical tic tac toe game made in python
- **vignere.php** - a website with description of the vignere cipher and encryptor/decryptor
- **roman-numerals.rock** - a program in the [Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) esolang that converts an Arab numeral into a Roman one
